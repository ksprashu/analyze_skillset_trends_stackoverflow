# Analysis of trends in Skillset data from Stackoverflow

## Data Acquisition

## Objective
In this analysis, we would like to take a look at the data sets of the stackoverflow surveys held year on year from 2011 to 2019 and see how the trends are changing year on year. 

## Installation
The jupyter notebook will run on a default installation of Anaconda. It is not necessary to install any additional modules for the purpose of running this code. 

The pre-requisite files will be downloaded by the script when run the first time.

## File Description

There are 3 files as part of this repository.

### acquire_files.pynb
This file is meant to be run first and as a one time activity. The file will download all the pre-requisite resources and datasets from stackoverflow and place them in the filesystem so that the other notebooks can use this data to do the analysis.
